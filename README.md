# Duck-God-Discord-Bot

## What is duck bot?
Duck bot is a discord python bot that I made for me and my friends to use in our discord server. We all are in a 'Cult' called the duck cult (Obviously as a joke). This bot has several 'duck cult' related commands. It also has a bunch of other commands. I made this bot because I was bored and wanted to learn how to make a discord bot. Prior to making this bot I had very little python knowledge(that hasnt really changed) and I had never made a discord bot before. I decided to set my self a challenge to make a bot in 5 days. So this bot was made in 5 days.
## Commands
All commands use the . prefix
Once you get the bot you can use: __.commands__ to list all the commands
For any help: __.help__

Or for help about a specific command __.help [commandname]__ 
Example: __.help sendroast__


## Get this bot for yourself

I know it says to give the bot admin. If you dont want to give him admin just click his role and edit his permissions.
